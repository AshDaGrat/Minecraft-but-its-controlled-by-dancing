# Minecraft but it's controlled by dancing

Inspired by one of Fundy's videos, I attempted to control Minecraft with dance moves. It didn't turn out too well, but it works about 30% of the time, and thats a big deal to me. 


# Controls

Dab - Right click

Heart above head - Left click

T Pose - Sprint 

Right hand to the side - Look right

Left hand to the side - Look Left

Right hand raised up - Scroll hotbar to the right 

Left hand raised up - Scroll hotbar to the left 


# Stuff to keep in mind

Ensure theres plenty of lighting, if the model doesnt recognise you, the program crashes. 

Ensure that the mouse cursor is on the minecraft window

Press esc to stop the program
